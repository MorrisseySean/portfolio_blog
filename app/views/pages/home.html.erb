          Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, 
          but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period
          so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you 
          this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through
          too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your
          dumb ass.

          Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It
          all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the 
          rch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And 
          most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way
          back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called 
          me Mr Glass.
